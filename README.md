# Slang Netlist

Slang Netlist is built on top of [slang](https://sv-lang.com) for analysing the
source-level static connectivity of a SystemVerilog design. It uses slang's AST
and data-flow analyses to construct a dependency graph of operations and
provides facilities for interacting with this data structure.

Slang Netlist is a C++ library and provides a command-line tool for interactive
use, and a Python module for straightforward integration into scripts.  Possible
applications include connectivity checks, CDC checks and timing path estimation.


## Features

- Bit-level resolution of data dependencies across continuous and procedural
  assignments.
- Procedural flow analysis in always blocks, including evaluation of
  constant-valued conditions, unrolling of static loops, and tracking of
  non-blocking assignments.
- Path finding and combinational loop detection.
- Driver, port, and register reporting.
- Multithreaded netlist construction for large designs.
- A command-line tool (``slang-netlist``) for interactive use, plus a
  companion tool (``slang-report``) that surfaces the underlying AST
  information — port declarations, typed variables and nets, drivers,
  and the elaborated AST as JSON — with shared glob-aware ``--scope``
  and ``--name`` filters.
- Python bindings for scripting.

## Example

Here's how to trace a path in a ripple-carry adder using the command-line tool:

```systemverilog
module rca
  #(parameter p_width = 8)
  (input  logic               i_clk,
   input  logic               i_rst,
   input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op0,
   input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op1,
   output logic [p_width-1:0] o_sum,
   output logic               o_co);

  logic [p_width-1:0] carry;
  logic [p_width-1:0] sum;
  logic [p_width-1:0] sum_q;
  logic               co_q;

  assign carry[0] = 1'b0;
  assign {o_co, o_sum} = {co_q, sum_q};

  for (genvar i = 0; i < p_width - 1; i++) begin
    assign {carry[i+1], sum[i]} = i_op0[i] + i_op1[i] + carry[i];
  end

  always_ff @(posedge i_clk or posedge i_rst)
    if (i_rst) begin
      sum_q <= {p_width{1'b0}};
      co_q  <= 1'b0;
    end else begin
      sum_q <= sum;
      co_q  <= carry[p_width-1];
    end

endmodule
```

Specifying start and end points for a path, ``slang-netlist`` searches for paths
between these points and returns information about a path, if it finds one.

```sh
slang-netlist rca.sv --from rca.i_op1 --to rca.o_sum
```

Example output:

```
tests/driver/rca.sv:6:31: note: input port i_op1
   input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op1,
                              ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:6:31: note: value rca.i_op1[0]
   input  logic [p_width-1:0] i_op1,
                              ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:19:12: note: assignment
    assign {carry[i+1], sum[i]} = i_op0[i] + i_op1[i] + carry[i];
           ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:10:23: note: value rca.carry[1]
  logic [p_width-1:0] carry;
                      ^
...
tests/driver/rca.sv:28:7: note: assignment
      co_q  <= carry[p_width-1];
      ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:13:23: note: value rca.co_q[0]
  logic               co_q;
                      ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:13:23: note: value rca.co_q[0]
  logic               co_q;
                      ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:16:10: note: assignment
  assign {o_co, o_sum} = {co_q, sum_q};
         ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:7:31: note: value rca.o_sum[7:0]
   output logic [p_width-1:0] o_sum,
                              ^
tests/driver/rca.sv:7:31: note: output port o_sum
```

### Python bindings

The same kind of analysis can be performed using the Python bindings. The
following example builds a netlist for a small ALU and checks connectivity
between ports (see [examples/connectivity_check.py](examples/connectivity_check.py)):

```python
import pyslang
import pyslang_netlist

# Compile the design.
tree = pyslang.syntax.SyntaxTree.fromText(r"""
  module alu(
    input  logic [7:0] a, b,
    input  logic       sel,
    output logic [7:0] result
  );
    assign result = sel ? (a + b) : (a - b);
  endmodule
""")
comp = pyslang.ast.Compilation()
comp.addSyntaxTree(tree)
comp.freeze()

# Run analysis and build the netlist.
am = pyslang.analysis.AnalysisManager()
am.analyze(comp)
graph = pyslang_netlist.NetlistGraph()
graph.build(comp, am)

# Check connectivity between two ports.
finder = pyslang_netlist.PathFinder()
path = finder.find(graph.lookup("alu.a"), graph.lookup("alu.result"))
assert not path.empty()
```

## Installation

Currently there are no pre-built binaries, so you will need to build from
source by cloning this repository or downloading a release.

### Building from source

Prerequisites:
- CMake >= 3.20
- Python 3
- C++20 compiler

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jameshanlon/slang-netlist.git
cd slang-netlist
cmake -B build \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install \
    -DENABLE_PY_BINDINGS=ON
cmake --build build -j --target install
ctest --test-dir build
```

When using the Python bindings, it is recommended to use the `pyslang` shared
object file that is produced and installed as part of the build. Different
versions of the upstream slang Python bindings may not work.

## Related Projects

- [Slang](https://github.com/MikePopoloski/slang) 'SystemVerilog compiler and
  language services' is the main library this project depends upon to provide
  access to an elaborated AST with facilities for code evaluation and data flow
  analysis.

- [Netlist Paths](https://github.com/jameshanlon/netlist-paths) is a previous
  iteration of this project, but it instead used Verilator to provide access an
  elaborated AST. This approach had limitations in the way variable selections
  were represented, making it possible only to trace dependencies between named
  variables.
